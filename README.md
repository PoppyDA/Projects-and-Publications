### Description

This was a passion project to get myself to learn PowerBI by integrating it with some code I wrote in Python to predict general Covid 19 trends. The program analyzes the NYTimes Covid19 case/death data to construct a 7-day rolling average of cases and deaths within the U.S.A, and utilizes the Gaussian process regression algorithm in sci-kit learn to predict the trend for the next 7 days.

By default the entire U.S.A is selected, but mixing-and-matching states and counties can be done via the selection tab.
